@(params: Map[String, Any])Your tax credits declaration for @{params("awardStartDate")} to @{params("awardEndDate")} has been received

Dear @{params("customerFName")}

Your reference number is @{params("renewalReference")}

What you can do next @defining((params("incompleteClaims").toString.toInt, params("anyEstimates").toString.toInt)) { case (ic, ae) =>
@if(ic > 0 || ae > 0){
You must:
@if(ic > 0) {- complete your @ic remaining annual review@if(ic > 1){s} to finish your renewal}
@if(ae > 0) {- contact us to tell us the actual amount for the estimate@if(ae > 1){s} you gave by @{params("contactDeadline")}. For contact details, search for 'tax credits general enquiries'}
}}
You can:
- log into tax credits and check the status of your renewal
- complete this declaration again if you think you made a mistake

What happens next

We will work out how much tax credits you:

- should have got in your award period
- will get from @{params("startDate")} to @{params("endDate")}, unless your claim has ended,
  and send you an award notice that you should get by @{params("noticeDate")}

If the amount was wrong, we will pay you the right amount or ask you to pay back any extra money.
