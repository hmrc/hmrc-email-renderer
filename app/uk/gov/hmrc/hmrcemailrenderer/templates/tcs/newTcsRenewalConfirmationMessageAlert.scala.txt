We will work out how much tax credits you:

- should have got in your award period
- will get from @{params("startDate")} to @{params("endDate")}, unless your claim has ended,
  and send you an award notice that you should get by @{params("noticeDate")}

If the amount was wrong, we will pay you the right amount or ask you to pay back any extra money.
