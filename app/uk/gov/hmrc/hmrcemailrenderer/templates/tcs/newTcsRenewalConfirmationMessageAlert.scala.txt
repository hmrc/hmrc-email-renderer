What you can do next

You can visit Manage your tax credits and sign in to:

- check if we have finished processing your renewal
- complete this declaration again if you think you made a mistake
- report any changes to your claim that have happened since 6 April 2017

You can also manage your tax credits using the HMRC app. It is available on Android, iOS and Windows.

What happens next

We will work out how much tax credits you:

- should have got already
- will get from @{params("startDate")} to @{params("endDate")}, unless your claim has ended,
  and send you an award notice that you should get by @{params("noticeDate")}

If the amount you got already was wrong, we will pay you the right amount or ask you to pay back any extra money.
