<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your PAYE Income Tax records have recently changed, which means the amount of tax you pay will change.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">For security reasons we do not give the full details here, but it could be because:</p>
<ul>
    @if(TemplateUtils.isP2TemplateAnnual) {
        <li>we have now calculated your tax code for the next tax year (tax year 2024 to 2025)</li>
    }
    <li>your job changed</li>
    <li>your pay changed</li>
    <li>your company benefits, such as a company car changed</li>
    <li>your pension changed</li></ul>
<p style="margin: 30px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><strong>How to check your details to make sure you pay the right amount of tax</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Search GOV.UK for ‘personal tax account’, sign in and go to the ‘Pay As You Earn (PAYE)’ section.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you sign in using a business tax account, you may be able to use it to access your personal tax account.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><strong>If you do not have a personal tax account</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You need to set one up before you can see your tax code change.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Search GOV.UK for ‘Personal tax account: sign in or set up’.</p>
