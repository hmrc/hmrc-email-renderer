<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @{params("fullName")}</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">Your PAYE Income Tax records have recently changed. For security reasons we do not give the full details here but it could be because of a change in something like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a job</li>
    <li>your pay</li>
    <li>your company benefits such as a company car</li>
    <li>your pension</li></ul>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means that the amount of Income Tax you will pay will change.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You should check your details to make sure they are right. This is so you pay the right amount of Income Tax.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Check your details</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Sign in to your Personal Tax Account and go to the 'Pay As You Earn (PAYE)' section.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">For security reasons we have not included a link in this email. To get to your Personal Tax Account search for 'HMRC Personal Tax Account'.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><strong>Signing in</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Use your Government Gateway or Verify details to sign in to your Personal Tax Account.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You should have access to these as you have already used the service to choose to receive emails.</p>
