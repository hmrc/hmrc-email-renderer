@(params: Map[String, Any])Your Income Tax estimate has changed

Dear @{params("fullName")}

We have changed your tax code and we would like you to check it is right.

This is to make sure you pay the right amount of tax.

Go to the 'Pay As You Earn (PAYE)' section of your Personal Tax Account.

You'll find your new tax code there with information on how we've calculated it.

For security reasons, we have not included a link with this email.
