@(params: Map[String, Any])You have a tax code change


Dear @{params("fullName")}

Your PAYE Income Tax records have recently changed, which means the amount of tax you pay will change.

For security reasons we do not give the full details here, but it could be because:

- we have now calculated your tax code for the next tax year (tax year 2021 to 2022)
- your job changed
- your pay changed
- your company benefits, such as a company car changed
- your pension changed


How to check your details to make sure you pay the right amount of tax

Search GOV.UK for ‘personal tax account’, sign in and go to the ‘Pay As You Earn (PAYE)’ section.

If you sign in using a business tax account, you may be able to use it to access your personal tax account.


If you do not have a personal tax account

You need to set one up before you can see your tax code change.

Search GOV.UK for ‘Personal tax account: sign in or set up’.
