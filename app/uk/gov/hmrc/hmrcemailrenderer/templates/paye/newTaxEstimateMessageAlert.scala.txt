@(params: Map[String, Any])Your Income Tax estimate has changed

Dear @{params("fullName")}

You have a tax code change

Your PAYE Income Tax records have recently changed. For security reasons we do not give the full details here but it could be because of a change in something like:

a job
your pay
your company benefits such as a company car
your pension

This means that the amount of Income Tax you will pay will change.

You should check your details to make sure they are right. This is so you pay the right amount of Income Tax.

Check your details

Sign in to your Personal Tax Account and go to the 'Pay As You Earn (PAYE)' section. 

For security reasons we have not included a link in this email. To get to your Personal Tax Account search for 'HMRC Personal Tax Account'.

Signing In

Use your Government Gateway or Verify details to sign in to your Personal Tax Account.

You should have access to these as you have already used the service to choose to receive emails.

Contact HMRC if you do not have your Government Gateway or Verify details.
