<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Dear @params.get("customerName")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Your claim reference: @params.get("claim_ref_no")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We have checked your claim and can confirm that you are eligible to receive a grant.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    However, we are unable to process your payment with the bank details you provided so we need you to check these.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you asked us to pay your grant into a building society account, you need to make sure you give us the roll number where one exists.</p>
<h2>How to update your details</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Go to the GOV.UK website and search for ‘Claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme’. In the section ‘Return to your claim’ you will have the option to check and amend your details.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will then process your payment and contact you again within 72 hours to confirm your payment is on its way.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Please only call us if you can’t find the information you need on GOV.UK &ndash; this will leave our lines open for those who need our help most.</p>
