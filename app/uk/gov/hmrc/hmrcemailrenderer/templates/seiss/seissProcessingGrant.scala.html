<h2>Report your grant if you claim Universal Credit</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you are claiming Universal Credit, you must sign in to your Universal Credit online account and report this grant as income.</p>

If someone gets in touch claiming to be from HMRC, saying that financial help can be claimed or that a tax refund is owed, and asks you to click on a link or to give information such as your name, credit card or bank details, please do not respond. You can forward suspicious emails claiming to be from HMRC to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk and texts to 60599.")</p>
