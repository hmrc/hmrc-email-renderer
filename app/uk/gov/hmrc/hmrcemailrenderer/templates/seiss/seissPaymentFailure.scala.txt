@(params: Map[String, Any])

We have processed your claim and now need you to check your bank details


Dear @params.get("customerName")

Your claim reference: @params.get("claim_ref_no")

We have checked your claim and can confirm that you are eligible to receive a grant.

However, we are unable to process your payment with the bank details you provided so we need you to check these.

If you asked us to pay your grant into a building society account, you need to make sure you give us the roll number where one exists.

How to update your details

Go to the GOV.UK website and search for ‘Claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme’. In the section ‘Return to your claim’ you will have the option to check and amend your details.

We will then process your payment and contact you again within 72 hours to confirm your payment is on its way.

Please only call us if you can’t find the information you need on GOV.UK – this will leave our lines open for those who need our help most.

A word about scams

@Html("We are aware of an increase in scam emails, calls and texts. If someone gets in touch claiming to be from HMRC, saying that financial help can be claimed or that a tax refund is owed, and asks you to click on a link or to give information such as your name, credit card or bank details, please do not respond. You can forward suspicious emails claiming to be from HMRC to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk and texts to 60599.")
