@(params: Map[String, Any])Pillar 2 Top-up Taxes

@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.txt.salutation(params)
@if(params("requestType") != "Below Threshold Notification") {
This is confirmation that on @{params("confirmationDate")} at @{params("confirmationTime")} HM Revenue & Customs received your Pillar 2 @{params("requestType")} for the Accounting Period @{params("accountingPeriodStart")} to @{params("accountingPeriodEnd")}.
}
@if(params("requestType") == "Below Threshold Notification") {
You have submitted a Below-Threshold Notification on @{params("confirmationDate")}. This is effective from the start of the accounting period you selected, @{params("accountingPeriodStart")}.

What happens next

The Below-Threshold Notification satisfies your group's obligation to submit a UK Tax Return for the current and future accounting periods. HMRC will not expect to receive an information return while your group remains below-threshold. You must submit a UK Tax Return if your group meets the threshold conditions in the future.
