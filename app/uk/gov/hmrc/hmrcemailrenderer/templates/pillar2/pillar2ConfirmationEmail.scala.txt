Pillar 2 Top-up Taxes – Below-Threshold Notification

You have submitted a Below-Threshold Notification on @{params("confirmationDate")}. This is effective from the start of the accounting period you selected, @{params("accountingPeriodStart")}.

What happens next

The Below-Threshold Notification satisfies your group's obligation to submit a UK Tax Return for the current and future accounting periods. HMRC will not expect to receive an information return while your group remains below-threshold. You must submit a UK Tax Return if your group meets the threshold conditions in the future.
