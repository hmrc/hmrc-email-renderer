@(params: Map[String, Any])Take action to stop your application being deleted

Dear @{params("userFirstName")} @{params("userLastName")}

According to our records, your application @{params("applicationName")} in our @{params("environmentName")} environment has not been used for @{params("timeSinceLastUse")}.

We permanently delete applications that have not been used for @{params("timeBeforeDeletion")}. They cannot be restored.

Your application will be deleted on or after @{params("dateOfScheduledDeletion")}.

What you can do now

- make an API call using its credentials before the scheduled deletion date

If you do not want to keep this application you can either:
- sign in to Developer Hub and delete it manually
- allow it to be removed automatically on the scheduled deletion date
