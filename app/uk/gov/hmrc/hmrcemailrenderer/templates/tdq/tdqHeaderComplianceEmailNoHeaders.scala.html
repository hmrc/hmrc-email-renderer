    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Dear @params("developerName")</p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        Our API call logs show that between @params("fromDate") and @params("toDate") no fraud prevention headers were submitted from @params("applicationName") (id: @params("applicationId")) to our VAT Making Tax Digital (MTD) APIs.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        We understand this is a difficult time due to coronavirus (COVID-19) but we still need to help protect your user's data. If you have developer capacity, it's important to start sending fraud prevention headers.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        We'll continue to monitor API call logs and give you feedback every month to help you do this. We'd like to reassure you that we'll continue to accept VAT MTD calls, including headers that are incorrect or missing.
    </p>

    <h2>What you need to do</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        You need to send header data with every request made by your application. Currently, your application is missing all of the header data.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
            Go to the HMRC Developer Hub.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
            Select the Fraud prevention link in the 'Get started' list.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
            Read the specification to learn how your application must submit the correct fraud prevention headers.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
            Use the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API (found in the list of VAT (MTD) APIs on the API documentation page) to check that the fraud prevention headers submitted by your application meet the requirements of HMRC's fraud prevention specification.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        Supplying header information for our VAT (MTD) APIs is required by law.
