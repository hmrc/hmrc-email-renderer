@(params: Map[String, Any])Fraud prevention headers status report

Dear @params("developerName")

@defining(ValidConnectionMethodBase64EncodedDetails.parse(params("extraDetails").toString)) { extraDetails =>
Our API call logs show that between @params("fromDate") and @params("toDate") fraud prevention headers were submitted from application '@params("applicationName")' (id: @params("applicationId")) to our VAT Making Tax Digital (MTD) API(s).

Our checks show that the fraud prevention headers submitted between these dates do not meet the requirements of the fraud prevention header specification on the HMRC Developer Hub.

The report below is generated based on our basic checks on the fraud prevention header values sent by your application, for example:

is the value for Gov-Client-Public-IP an IP address?

is the IP address value for Gov-Client-Public-IP a public IP?

The report below shows results for requests that provided the value for Gov-Client-Connection-Method header as @extraDetails.connectionMethod. It does not include headers that appear to be valid.

If your application sent additional requests with a different value for the Gov-Client-Connection-Method you will receive separate reports for each.

Errors and/or warnings may relate to more than one version of your software as provided in the Gov-Vendor-Version header.

Report

'@params("applicationName")' using connection method @extraDetails.connectionMethod submitted @extraDetails.requestCount requests between @params("fromDate") and @params("toDate").

These are the headers where errors and/or warnings have been found:

@for(headersValidation <- extraDetails.headerValidations) {

@headersValidation.headerOrHeaders
@if(headersValidation.errors.nonEmpty) {
  errors
@for(error <- headersValidation.errors) {
    @error.message (@error.percentageDescription) }}
@if(headersValidation.warnings.nonEmpty) {
  warnings
@for(warning <- headersValidation.warnings) {
    @warning.message (@warning.percentageDescription) }}
}

What you must do next

Read the fraud prevention specification so that you can make sure that your application submits the correct fraud prevention headers.

Use the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API (found in the list of VAT (MTD) APIs on the API documentation page) to check that the fraud prevention headers submitted by your application meet the requirements of HMRC’s fraud prevention specification.

If the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API shows that your application is submitting the correct headers, please check that your end user is using the latest version of your application.

We will continue to monitor API call logs every month and give you feedback to help you meet the legal requirements.
