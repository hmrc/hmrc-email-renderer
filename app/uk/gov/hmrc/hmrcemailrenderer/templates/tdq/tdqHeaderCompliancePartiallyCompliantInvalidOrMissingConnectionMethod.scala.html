    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Dear @params("developerName")</p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        Our API call logs show that between @params("fromDate") and @params("toDate") fraud prevention headers were submitted from application '@params("applicationName")' (id: @params("applicationId")) to our VAT Making Tax Digital (MTD) API(s).
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        Our checks show that some or all requests during this period had an invalid or missing value for the Gov-Client-Connection-Method header (other headers may or may not have been sent).
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        However, if you are unable to collect a header value due to the restrictions explained within the fraud prevention header specification, and if you are omitting the header or leaving a value blank, then please contact HMRC.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        You have not provided the Gov-Client-Connection-Method header correctly and therefore you are not submitting valid fraud prevention headers. When you provide a correct Gov-Client-Connection-Method, we will validate your fraud prevention headers and send you a full header status report.
    </p>

    <h2>What you must do next</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin-bottom: 19px;">
            Read the fraud prevention specification so that you can make sure that your application submits the correct fraud prevention headers.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin-bottom: 19px;">
            Use the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API (found in the list of VAT (MTD) APIs on the API documentation page) to check that the fraud prevention headers submitted by your application meet the requirements of HMRCâ€™s fraud prevention specification.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin-bottom: 19px;">
            If the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API shows that your application is submitting the correct headers, please check that your end user is using the latest version of your application.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">
        We will continue to monitor API call logs every month and give you feedback to help you meet the legal requirements.
    </p>
