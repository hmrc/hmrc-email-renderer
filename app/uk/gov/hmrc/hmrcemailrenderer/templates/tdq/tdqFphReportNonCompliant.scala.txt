Dear @reportParams.developerName

To help protect your customers' confidential data from criminals and fraudsters, we monitor API calls and send you feedback every month.

Our logs show that the fraud prevention headers submitted for @reportParams.applicationName between @reportParams.fromDate and @reportParams.toDate do not meet the specification on the HMRC Developer Hub.

Check your application meets version 3.0

The 6 month period to implement changes in version 3.0 of the Fraud Prevention Headers specification ended in July 2021. Warnings about changes are now shown as errors.

You'll find version 3.0 of the fraud prevention specification on the HMRC Developer Hub. Select your connection method or view the change log to check you've made all of the changes.

What you need to do

Submitting header data for VAT (MTD) APIs is required by law.

@if(reportParams.hasInvalidConnectionMethod) {@if(reportParams.invalidConnectionMethodPercentage == 100) {Your application has an invalid connection method in all requests.} else {Your application has an invalid connection method in @reportParams.invalidConnectionMethodCount requests (@reportParams.invalidConnectionMethodPercentage% of all requests).}}

To meet the specification, you need to:

@if(reportParams.hasInvalidConnectionMethod) {Go to the specification and select the correct connection method for your application. Check what has changed.}

Submit header data for every request made by your application.@if(reportParams.hasAllHeadersMissing) { Your application is missing all of the header data in @reportParams.allHeadersMissingPercentage% of requests.}

@if(reportParams.hasErrors) {Correct the errors @if(reportParams.hasWarnings){and consider the warnings }shown in this report.}
@if(reportParams.hasWarnings && !reportParams.hasErrors) {Consider the warnings shown in this report.}

Check your data meets the specification and is formatted correctly.

Use the testing tools

Before submitting data, you need to use the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API. You can access it from the specification on the HMRC Developer Hub.

Use the validate endpoint to get immediate feedback for a single request. Then, use the validation-feedback endpoint to get feedback on the last request made to each endpoint.

If the Test Fraud Prevention Headers API shows that you're submitting the correct headers, check if your end users are using an outdated version of your application.

@if(reportParams.hasErrors || reportParams.hasWarnings) {
@if(reportParams.hasErrors) {You need to correct errors @if(reportParams.hasWarnings){and consider warnings}} else {You need to consider warnings}

We've made basic checks on header values sent by your application. This includes requests with all headers missing. It does not include headers that appear to be valid.

If your application sent requests via an additional connection method, you'll receive a separate report.

@if(reportParams.relatesToMultipleVersions) {Errors and warnings relate to more than 1 version of your software, as provided in the Gov-Vendor-Version header.}


@for(extraDetails <- reportParams.extraDetails) {@extraDetails.prettyConnectionMethod

@reportParams.extraDetails.get.requestCount requests between @reportParams.fromDate and @reportParams.toDate

@for(headersValidation <- extraDetails.headerValidations) {
@headersValidation.prettyHeaderOrHeaders

@for(error <- headersValidation.errors) {Error @error.message @error.prettyCount @error.shortPercentageDescription

}@for(warning <- headersValidation.warnings) {Warning @warning.message @warning.prettyCount @warning.shortPercentageDescription

}}
Missing data

Most organisations are able to send all header data required for their connection method. If you're unable to submit a value, check what you need to do in the missing header section of the specification.
