Dear @reportParams.developerName

To help protect your customers' confidential data from criminals and fraudsters, we monitor API calls and send you feedback every month.

Our logs show that all of the fraud prevention headers submitted for @reportParams.applicationName between @reportParams.fromDate and @reportParams.toDate meet the current specification on the HMRC Developer Hub. Thank you, we'll send you a report if this changes.

Why you have received this email

This email address is registered on Developer Hub for @reportParams.applicationName.

If you're no longer working on @reportParams.applicationName, an application admin needs to remove you from the team on Developer Hub.
