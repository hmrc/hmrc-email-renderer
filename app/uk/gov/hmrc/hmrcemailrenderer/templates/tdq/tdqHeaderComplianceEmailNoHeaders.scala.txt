@(params: Map[String, Any])Reminder to use fraud prevention headers for VAT MTD

Dear Sir or Madam

Our API call logs show that between @params("fromDate") and @params("toDate") no fraud prevention headers were submitted in calls from @params("applicationName") (id: @params("applicationId")) to our VAT Making Tax Digital (MTD) API(s).

Supplying header information for our VAT (MTD) API is required by law. Fraud prevention headers must comply with the HMRC fraud prevention policy.

What you must do next

The fraud prevention link on the HMRC Developer Hub will show you the specification for the fraud prevention headers.

Read the specification to make sure that the fraud prevention headers you submit are correct.

We will continue to monitor API call logs every month and give you feedback to help you meet the legal requirements.
