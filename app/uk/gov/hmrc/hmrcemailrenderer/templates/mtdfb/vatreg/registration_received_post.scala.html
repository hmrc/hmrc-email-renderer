    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">So we can process your application, you need to post us a cover letter and copies of your documents. For information on how to do this, sign in to ‘Register for VAT’ online and view your existing applications.</p>

    <h2 style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">What happens next</h2>

    <ol>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">After we receive copies of your documents, we’ll write to you with a decision on your application in about 30 days.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You should wait until we confirm your VAT registration before you get software to follow the rules for ‘Making Tax Digital for VAT’.</li>
