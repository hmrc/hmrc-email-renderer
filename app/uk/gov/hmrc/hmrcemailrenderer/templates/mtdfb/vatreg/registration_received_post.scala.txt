@(params: Map[String, Any])We’ve received your VAT registration application

Dear @params("name")

Reference number: @params("ref")

So we can process your application, you need to post us a cover letter and copies of your documents. For information on how to do this, sign in to ‘Register for VAT’ online and view your existing applications.

What happens next

After we receive copies of your documents, we’ll write to you with a decision on your application in about 40 days.
You should wait until we confirm your VAT registration before you get software to follow the rules for ‘Making Tax Digital for VAT’.

You cannot include VAT on your invoices until you get your VAT number. However, you can increase your prices to account for the VAT you’ll need to pay HMRC.
