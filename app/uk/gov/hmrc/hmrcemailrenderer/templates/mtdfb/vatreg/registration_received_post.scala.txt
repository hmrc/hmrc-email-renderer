@(params: Map[String, Any])We’ve received your VAT registration application

Dear @params("name")

Reference number: @params("ref")

We’ve received your application. So we can process it, you need to post us a cover letter and copies of your identity documents. For information on how to do this, sign in to ‘Register for VAT’ online and view your existing applications.

What happens next

After we get copies of your documents, we’ll write to you with a decision on your application. This usually takes us about 30 days.

You should wait until your VAT registration is confirmed before you:
- get any software
- charge customers for VAT
