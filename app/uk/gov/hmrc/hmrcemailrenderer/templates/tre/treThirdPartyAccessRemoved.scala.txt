@(params: Map[String, Any])

Dear customer

@{params.getOrElse("businessName", "A business")} has removed your third-party access to their customs declaration data. You can no longer request or download CDS reports on their behalf.

This change only affects access to @{if(params.get("businessName").isDefined){"this"}else{"that"}} business.

You do not need to take any action.
