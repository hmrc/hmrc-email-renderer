    Dear customer

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
    @{params.getOrElse("businessName", "A business")} has removed your third-party access to their customs declaration data. You can no longer request or download CDS reports on their behalf.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
    This change only affects access to @{if(params.get("businessName").isDefined){"this"}else{"that"}} business.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
    You do not need to take any action.
