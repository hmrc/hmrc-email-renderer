@(params: Map[String, Any])You are registered to pay VAT to the EU on distance sales of goods from Northern Ireland

@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.txt.salutation(params)

HMRC has received the registration from @params("businessName").

You need to charge VAT at the rate of the EU country where the goods are sent to.

For each calendar quarter, you need to use the new One Stop Shop service to:

- complete a single return for eligible sales of goods to consumers in the EU

- make a payment to HMRC of the total VAT due on eligible sales of goods to consumers in the EU

Your first return will be for eligible sales starting from @params("startDate") to @params("lastDayOfCalendarQuarter").

What happens next

We will contact you if we need to check any information.

We will contact you about how to use the new service to submit your first return and make payment by @params("lastDayOfMonthAfterCalendarQuarter").
