Your Direct Debit has been cancelled.

We have sent you a secure message. To read it:

1. Go to GOV.UK.
2. Search for 'Set up a Direct Debit for a duty deferment account on the Customs Declaration Service' and sign in.

If you want to carry on using your duty deferment account or you have outstanding charges to pay, you will need to set up a new Direct Debit instruction.
