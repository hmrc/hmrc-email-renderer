VAT Return Direct Debit: important information

Dear @params("NAME")

We need to give you some information after your transfer to Making Tax Digital for VAT. There is no need for you to take any action.

You currently pay your VAT Return by Direct Debit. From @DateFormatter.formatDate(params("TRANSFERDATE").toString) we will transfer your Direct Debit over.

Your new reference is: @params("DDIREFERENCE").
Your new service number is: @params("NEWSUN").

Payments will appear on your bank statement as '@params("NEWSUNNAME")'.

Your bank statement may show a final payment as '@params("OLDSUNNAME")' and then a first payment as '@params("NEWSUNNAME")'.

If you have any questions, call @params("PHONENUMBER").

From HMRC Direct Debit Team

- This guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay Direct Debits.
- If there are any changes to the amount, date or frequency of your Direct Debit we will notify you 2 working days in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise agreed. If you request @params("NEWSUNNAME") to collect a payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.
- If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit by @params("NEWSUNNAME") or your bank or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid from your bank or building society.
- If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when @params("NEWSUNNAME") asks you to.
