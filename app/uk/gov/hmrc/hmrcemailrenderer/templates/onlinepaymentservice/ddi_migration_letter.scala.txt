Information on your direct debit for VAT returns

Dear @params("NAME")

We need to give you some information after your transfer to Making Tax Digital for VAT. There is no need for you to take any action.

You currently pay your VAT return by direct debit. From @formatDate(params("TRANSFERDATE").toString) we will transfer your direct debit over and your reference will change from '@params("OLDSUNNAME")' to '@params("NEWSUNNAME")'. Your new service number is: @params("NEWSUN").

Your bank statement may show a final payment under the old reference and a first payment under the new reference.

{Examples to be included}

If you have any questions, call 0300 200 3700.
