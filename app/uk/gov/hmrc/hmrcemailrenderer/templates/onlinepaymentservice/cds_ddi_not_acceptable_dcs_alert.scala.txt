@(params: Map[String, Any])HMRC Duty Deferred: Direct Debit instruction cannot be used

@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.txt.salutationLine1(params)
Your bank has told us we cannot collect payments using this Direct Debit instruction.

We have sent you a secure message. To read it:

1. Go to GOV.UK.
2. Search for ‘Manage your import duties and VAT accounts’ and sign in.

If you have outstanding charges to pay, you will need to pay them immediately. If you want to continue to use your duty deferment account, you will need to set up a new Direct Debit instruction.
