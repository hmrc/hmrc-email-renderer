    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your bank has told us we cannot collect payments using this Direct Debit instruction.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We have sent you a secure message. To read it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Go to GOV.UK.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Search for ‘Manage your import duties and VAT accounts’ and sign in.</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        If you have outstanding charges to pay, you will need to pay them immediately. If you want to continue to use your duty deferment account, you will need to set up a new Direct Debit instruction.
    </p>
