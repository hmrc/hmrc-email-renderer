<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @params("NAME")</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We need to give you some information after your transfer to Making Tax Digital for VAT. This transfer may have been requested by you or by someone who deals with HMRC for you.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">There is no need to take any action.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You currently pay by Direct Debit. From @DateFormatter.formatDate(params("TRANSFERDATE").toString) we will transfer your Direct Debit to a new reference @params("DDIREFERENCE").</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The Service User name will change from HMRC e VAT to HMRC E VAT DDS. Your new service user number will be @params("NEWSUN").</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your bank statement may show a final payment under your old reference and a first payment under the new reference.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We have also updated our Direct Debit terms and conditions, please read them below.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You will continue to enjoy the full benefits of the Direct Debit guarantee as detailed below, if you have a question call @params("PHONENUMBER").</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay Direct Debits.</li><p>

If you request @params("NEWSUNNAME") to collect a payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.</li><p>

    </p><li>If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit by @params("NEWSUNNAME") or your bank or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid from your bank or building society<br>â€” If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when @params("NEWSUNNAME") asks you to.</li><p>

    </p><li>You can cancel a Direct Debit at any time by simply contacting your bank or building society. Written confirmation may be required. Please also notify us.</li>

        <li>When submitting a new Direct Debit Instruction, you must be authorised to sign for the account as either the sole signatory or authorised to sign on behalf of all the other signatories.<br>

        <li>If you miss the due date for your VAT payment, or complete your VAT Return late, you could be liable to a financial penalty. If you know that the Direct Debit collection will fail, you must pay by the due date using another method.</li>
