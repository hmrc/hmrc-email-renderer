<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @params("NAME")</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We need to give you some information after your transfer to Making Tax Digital for VAT. There is no need for you to take any action.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You currently pay your VAT return by Direct Debit. From @DateFormatter.formatDate(params("TRANSFERDATE").toString) we will transfer your Direct Debit over.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your new reference is: @params("DDIREFERENCE").
    <br>Your new service number is: @params("NEWSUN").</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Payments will appear on your bank statement as '@params("NEWSUNNAME")'.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your bank statement may show a final payment as '@params("OLDSUNNAME")' and then a first payment as '@params("NEWSUNNAME")'.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you have any questions, call @params("PHONENUMBER").</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">From HMRC Direct Debit Team</p>


<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px; text-align: right"><strong>The Direct Debit Guarantee</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/3.0.2/images/direct-debit-logo.png" width="175" alt="direct debit logo"></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay Direct Debits.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If there are any changes to the amount, date or frequency of your Direct Debit we will notify you 2 working days in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise agreed. If you request @params("NEWSUNNAME") to collect a payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit by @params("NEWSUNNAME") or your bank or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid from your bank or building society.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when @params("NEWSUNNAME") asks you to.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can cancel a Direct Debit at any time by simply contacting your bank or building society. Written confirmation may be required. Please also notify us.</p>
