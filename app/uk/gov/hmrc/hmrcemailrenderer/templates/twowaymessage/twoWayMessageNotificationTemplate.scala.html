    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear customer</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We recently spoke to you by phone.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        We believe we have now answered your @params.get("date").fold("")(date => DateHelper.dateFormatter(date.toString)) question about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Because of this, we have now closed your query.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you need to ask another question, you must send a new message.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Do not contact HMRC by phone about this question, or reply to this email. We do not monitor this inbox.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">From the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme team.</p>
