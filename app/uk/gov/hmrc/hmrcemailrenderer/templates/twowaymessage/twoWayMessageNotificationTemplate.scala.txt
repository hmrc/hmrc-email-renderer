Dear Customer

We recently spoke to you by phone.

We believe we have now answered your @params.get("date").fold("")(date => DateHelper.dateFormatter(date.toString)) question about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

Because of this, we have now closed your query.

If you need to ask another question, you must send a new message.

Do not contact HMRC by phone about this question, or reply to this email. We do not monitor this inbox.
