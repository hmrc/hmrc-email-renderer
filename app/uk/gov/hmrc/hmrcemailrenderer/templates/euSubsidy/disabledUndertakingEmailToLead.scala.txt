@(params: Map[String, Any])

You created a new single undertaking

Dear Customer

This email confirms that you @{params("eori")} have disabled your single undertaking:

@{params("undertakingName")}
@{params("undertakingRef")}

This means you will no longer be able to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers, for this undertaking. It has been permanently disabled.

This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

If you need further information

Search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.
