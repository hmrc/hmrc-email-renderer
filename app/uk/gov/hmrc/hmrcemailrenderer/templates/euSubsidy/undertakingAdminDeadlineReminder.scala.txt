Dear Customer

You must submit a report of any non-customs subsidy payments or no payments by (DEADLINE: @{params("deadline")}).

These payments are from government and public authorities. This must be done at least once every 90 days.

If you do not report these payments or no payments received for this period, you will no longer be able to claim Customs Duty waivers.

Submitting a report

To submit a report of a payment or a non-payment, search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'.
