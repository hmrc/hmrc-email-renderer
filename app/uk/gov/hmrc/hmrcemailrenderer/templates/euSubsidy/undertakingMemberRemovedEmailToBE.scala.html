    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email confirms that you, EORI number @{params("eori")}, have been removed from an undertaking. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        Reported payments for this business will remain in your undertaking, and will continue to affect your remaining sector allowance.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        These reported payments will be removed only when the business joins or creates another undertaking.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        If you think you have been removed by mistake, contact the undertaking administrator.
    </p>
