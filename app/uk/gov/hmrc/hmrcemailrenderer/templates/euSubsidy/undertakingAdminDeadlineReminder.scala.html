    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You must submit a report of any non-customs subsidy payments or no payments by @{params("deadline")}. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">These payments are from government and public authorities. This must be done at least once every 90 days. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you do not report these payments or no payments received for this period, you will no longer be able to claim Customs Duty waivers. </p>

    <h2>Submitting a report </h2>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">To submit a report of a payment or a non-payment, search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'. </p>
