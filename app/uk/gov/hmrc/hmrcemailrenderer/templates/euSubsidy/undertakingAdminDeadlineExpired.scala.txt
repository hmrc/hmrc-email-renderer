Dear Customer

Your deadline for submitting a report of any non-customs subsidy payments or no payments, has passed.

You will not be able to claim further Customs Duty waivers until you have submitted a report, which must be done at least once every 90 days.

These payments can include grants and loans from government and public authorities. You should check if these were provided as de minimis state aid.

Submitting a report

To submit a report of a payment or a non-payment, search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'.

After submitting a report it may take up to 24 hours before you can continue to claim any further Customs Duty waivers that you may be entitled to.
