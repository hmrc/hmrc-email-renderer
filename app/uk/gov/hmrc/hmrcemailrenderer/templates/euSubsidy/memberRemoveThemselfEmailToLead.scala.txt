@(params: Map[String, Any])

An undertaking member has removed themselves from your single undertaking

Dear Customer

This email confirms that (EORI: @{params("eori")}) has informed HMRC they want to leave the single undertaking:

@{params("undertakingName")}

You will no longer be required to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers.

This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

If you need further information

Search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.
