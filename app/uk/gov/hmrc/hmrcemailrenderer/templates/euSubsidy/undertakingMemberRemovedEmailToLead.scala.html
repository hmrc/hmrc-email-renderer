    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email confirms that you (EORI: @{params("eori")}) have removed EORI: @{params("beEORI")} from the single undertaking:
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">@{params("undertakingName")}<br>
    @{params("undertakingRef")}</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This will be effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The former member will no longer be able to claim Customs Duty waivers as part of this single undertaking. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You must inform them they have been removed. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This change does not take effect immediately and may take up to 24 hours to go through.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means the former member will still be in the undertaking until the change happens.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You must inform them they have been removed. </p>
    <h2>If you need further information </h2>
