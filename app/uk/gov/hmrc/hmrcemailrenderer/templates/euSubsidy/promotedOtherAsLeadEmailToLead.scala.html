    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email confirms that you (EORI: @{params("eori")}) have asked for EORI: @{params("beEORI")} to take over as undertaking administrator for the undertaking:</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">@{params("undertakingName")}
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><b>You need to sign in to complete the transfer.</b></p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">To sign in, and for further guidance, search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Once the transfer is complete you will no longer be the undertaking administrator. You will need to keep the new undertaking administrator updated on your usage of de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><b>Make sure EORI: @{params("beEORI")} is aware it will be their responsibility to make sure all single undertaking details are correct and up to date. </b></p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">From HMRC</p>
