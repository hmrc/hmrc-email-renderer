@(params: Map[String, Any])

You have promoted an undertaking member to become the new undertaking administrator (lead)

Dear Customer

This email confirms (EORI: @{params("eori")}) have asked for EORI: @{params("beEORI")} to take over as undertaking administrator for the undertaking:

@{params("undertakingName")}
@{params("undertakingRef")}

You need to sign in, and agree to the terms and conditions, to complete the transfer.

To sign in, and for further guidance, search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.

Once the transfer is complete you will no longer be the undertaking administrator. You will need to keep the new undertaking administrator updated on your usage of de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers.

Make sure EORI: @{params("beEORI")} is aware it will be their responsibility to make sure all single undertaking details are correct and up to date.

From HMRC
