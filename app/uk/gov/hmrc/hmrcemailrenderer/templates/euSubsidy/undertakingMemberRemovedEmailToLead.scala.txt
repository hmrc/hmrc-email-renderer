An undertaking member has been removed from your single undertaking

Dear Customer

This email confirms that you (EORI: @{params("eori")}) have removed EORI: @{params("beEORI")} from the single undertaking

This will be effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

The former member will no longer be able to claim Customs Duty waivers as part of this single undertaking.

You must inform them they have been removed.

This change does not take effect immediately and may take up to 24 hours to go through.

This means the former member will still be in the undertaking until the change happens.
