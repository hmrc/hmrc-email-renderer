    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your deadline for submitting a report of any non-customs subsidy payments or no payments, has passed. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You will not be able to claim further Customs Duty waivers until you have submitted a report, which must be done at least once every 90 days. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">These payments can include grants and loans from government and public authorities. You should check if these were provided as de minimis state aid. </p>

    <h2>Submitting a report </h2>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">To submit a report of a payment or no payments, search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">After submitting a report it may take up to 24 hours before you can continue to claim any further Customs Duty waivers that you may be entitled to. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"> From Borders & Trade team </p>
