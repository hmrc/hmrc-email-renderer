@(params: Map[String, Any])

The undertaking you are part of has been disabled

Dear Customer

This email confirms that the single undertaking(@{params("eori")}) you are part of has been disabled:

@{params("undertakingName")}
@{params("undertakingRef")}

This means you will no longer be able to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers, for this undertaking. It has been permanently disabled.

This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

If you need further information

Search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.
