@(params: Map[String, Any])

The undertaking you are part of has been disabled

Dear Customer

This email confirms that the single undertaking(@{params("eori")}) you are part of has been disabled:

@{params("undertakingName")}

This means you will no longer be able to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers, for this undertaking. It has been permanently disabled.

This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

The change does not take effect immediately and may take up to 24 hours to go through.

This means you will still be in the undertaking until the change happens.

If you need further information

Search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'.

From HMRC
