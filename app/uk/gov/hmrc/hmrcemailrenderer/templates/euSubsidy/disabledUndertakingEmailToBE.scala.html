    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email confirms that single undertaking(@{params("eori")}) you are part of has been disabled:</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">@{params("undertakingName")}</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means you will no longer be able to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers, for this undertaking. It has been permanently disabled.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The change does not take effect immediately and may take up to 24 hours to go through.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means you will still be in the undertaking until the change happens.</p>
    <h2>If you need further information </h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Search GOV.UK for 'Report and manage your allowance for Customs Duty waiver claims'.</p>
