    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear Customer</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email confirms that single undertaking(@{params("eori")}) you are part of has been disabled:</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">@{params("undertakingName")}<br>
    @{params("undertakingRef")}</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means you will no longer be able to record de minimis aid, unrelated to Customs Duty waivers, for this undertaking. It has been permanently disabled.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.</p>
    <h2>If you need further information </h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.</p>
