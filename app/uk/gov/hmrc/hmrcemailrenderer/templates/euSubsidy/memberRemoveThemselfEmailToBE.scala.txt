@(params: Map[String, Any])

You have asked to leave a single undertaking

Dear Customer

This email confirms that you (EORI: @{params("eori")}) have informed HMRC that you will leave the single undertaking:

@{params("undertakingName")}
@{params("undertakingRef")}

This is effective from @{params("effectiveDate")}.

You will no longer be able to claim Customs Duty waivers as part of this undertaking.

We have also informed the undertaking administrator of your decision.

If you wish to claim Customs Duty waivers in the future you will have to be a member of another undertaking, or create your own.

If you need further information

Search GOV.UK for 'Report and check de minimis aid if you claimed a waiver for goods brought into Northern Ireland'.
