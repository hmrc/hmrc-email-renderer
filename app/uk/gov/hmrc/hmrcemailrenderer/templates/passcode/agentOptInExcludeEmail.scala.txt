@(params: Map[String, Any])Go back to using the original HMRC online services

Dear @{params("name")}

You’ve told us that you want to stop using the new Agent Services and go back to the original HMRC online services.

After you switch back, you’ll be able to use all your usual online services, but you won’t be able to access your employer client's liabilities and payments information anymore.

If you want to rejoin the new Agent Services in future, you must email aoss-team.mailbox@@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk with the subject line: Request to rejoin the new Agent Services.

Click on the link below and sign in to your service to begin the switching process.

@{params("verificationLink")}

This unique link will only work once, so make sure you finish the process in one go.

From HMRC Agent Services
