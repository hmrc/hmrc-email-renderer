@(params: Map[String, Any])Start using HMRC GMP checker

Dear Pension Scheme Administrator

You told us you’d like to use our Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) checker. You can now use the service.

You can use the GMP checker when a pension scheme member:

leaves the scheme

divorces

transfers

You’ll get results from the service in real time.

Before you start

Go to GOV.UK and search for 'GMP checker'. Sign in with your existing HMRC online details. If you do not have sign in details you can create them.

For security reasons, we have not included a link with this email.
