    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Thank you for sending the CT600 submission online.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">HM Revenue and Customs(HMRC) have received the submission for reference @params("identifier") on @params("receivedDate"). </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">It will be processed depending on further validation checks. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This usually takes at least 2 working days and you can check the progress for the return accounting period in the Corporation Tax section of the company's online tax account.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">All parts of the Company Tax Return must be proper and complete and the content must be viewable by HMRC officers.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">HMRC can't confirm that this submission meets that requirement until we've processed it and will notify you at a later date if the submission is not a valid Company Tax Return.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">HMRC no longer issues paper acknowledgements. We recommend that you keep this email and a copy of the return.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The easiest way to make Corporation Tax payments is from the online tax account. You can also make payments at www.gov.uk/pay-corporation-tax.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Use the 17 digit payment reference appropriate to the accounting period, for example 1234005678A00101A.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can find the payment reference for each accounting period in the online tax account.</p>
