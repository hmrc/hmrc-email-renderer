@(params: Map[String,Any])
Thank you for sending the CT600 submission online.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have received the submission for reference @params("identifier") on @params("receivedDate").

It will be processed depending on further validation checks.

This usually takes at least 2 working days and you can check the progress for the return accounting period in the Corporation Tax section of the company's online tax account.

All parts of the Company Tax Return must be proper and complete and the content must be viewable by HMRC officers.

HMRC can't confirm that this submission meets that requirement until we’ve processed it and will notify you at a later date if the submission is not a valid Company Tax Return.

HMRC no longer issues paper acknowledgements. We recommend that you keep this email and a copy of the return.

The easiest way to make Corporation Tax payments is from the online tax account. You can also make payments at www.gov.uk/pay-corporation-tax.

Use the 17 digit payment reference appropriate to the accounting period, for example 1234005678A00101A.

You can find the payment reference for each accounting period in the online tax account.
