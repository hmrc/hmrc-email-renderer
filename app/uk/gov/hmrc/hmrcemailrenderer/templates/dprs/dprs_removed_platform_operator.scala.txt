@(params: Map[String, Any])You have removed a platform operator

Dear @{params("userPrimaryContactName")}

You have successfully removed @{params("poBusinessName")} as a platform operator from the digital platform reporting service.

You can no longer:

    - send reports for this platform operator ID @{params("poId")}
    - access or change details for this platform operator ID @{params("poId")}

What happens next

You do not need to take any further action.

If you need to start reporting for this platform operator again, you can add them to the service again. Go to GOV.UK and search for 'manage your digital platform reporting'.

For security reasons, we have not included a link to this service in this email.

For more information, search GOV.UK for 'check if you need to carry out digital platform reporting'.
