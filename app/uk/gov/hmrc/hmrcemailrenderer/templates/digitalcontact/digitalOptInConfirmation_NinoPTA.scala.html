<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Now you have signed up to online tax letters, we want to tell you more.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Our promise to you</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We will:</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">* send you key online tax letters, such as if you have paid too little or too much tax or, if you are a Self Assessment customer, when your return is due<br/>* email to let you know whenever you have a new letter to read</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You will never miss a tax letter</h2>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We will write to you by post if:</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">* an email notification ever bounces (we send an email, but it does not reach you and is returned to us)<br/>* you have not actioned something important</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This service is still growing, so at the moment we only send some tax letters online. This is changing so you can be confident all your important tax letters will be in one place.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can also print them at any time, so you have a paper copy if you ever need one.</p>
