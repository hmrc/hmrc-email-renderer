File failed checks for the CBC reporting service


Dear @{params("contactName")}

There is a problem with the file you tried to send for your @{forClientTradingName(params)} with the CBC ID @{params("cbcId")}.
The file failed the country-by-country reporting checks at @{params("dateSubmitted")}.

You must send another version. Not sending another report on time may result in a penalty for your client.

You can check the errors in the country-by-country reporting service and upload an updated XML file.

For reference, the File ID (MessageRefId) is:
@{params("messageRefId")}

You can check the errors in the CBC service and upload an updated XML file.

For security reasons, we have not included a link to this service in this email.


If you need help

Email your HMRC Customer Compliance Manager or
msb.countrybycountryreportingmailbox@@hmrc.gov.uk for help with this service.

For more information on CBC, you can visit GOV.UK and search for ‘country-by-country reporting’.
