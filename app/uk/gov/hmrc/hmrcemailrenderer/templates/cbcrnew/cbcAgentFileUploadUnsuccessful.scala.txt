File failed checks for the CBC reporting service


Dear @{params("contactName")}

We have not accepted the file for your @{forClientTradingName(params)} with the CBC ID @{params("cbcId")}. The file failed the country-by-country reporting checks at @{params("dateSubmitted")}.

For reference, the File ID (MessageRefId) is:
@{params("messageRefId")}

You can check the errors in the CBC service and upload an updated XML file.

For security reasons, we have not included a link to this service in this email.
