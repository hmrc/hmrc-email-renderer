There is a problem with your file for CBC


Dear @{params("contactName")}


There is a problem with the file you tried to send for @{params("orgName")}  at at @{params("dateSubmitted")} for country-by-country reporting.

You must send another version. Not sending another report on time may result in a penalty.

You can check the errors in the country-by-country reporting service and upload an updated XML file.

For reference, the File ID (MessageRefId) is:
@{params("messageRefId")}

For security reasons, we have not included a link to this service in this email.


If you need help

Email your HMRC Customer Compliance Manager or msb.countrybycountryreportingmailbox@@hmrc.gov.uk for help with this service.

For more information on CBC, you can visit GOV.UK and search for ‘country-by-country reporting’.
