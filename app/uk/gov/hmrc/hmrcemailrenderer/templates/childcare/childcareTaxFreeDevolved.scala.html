    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Tax-Free Childcare is for working parents with children under 12 years old (or disabled children under 17).</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">For every £8 that you pay into your childcare account, the government will pay in £2, up to a maximum of £2,000 per child per year (or £4,000 for disabled children). You can then use this to pay for childcare.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can apply now and start using Tax-Free Childcare to pay for childcare straight away.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can find out more and check if you’re eligible at:   <a href="http://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk ">www.childcarechoices.gov.uk </a></p>
