    <p style="margin: 0 0 20px; font-size: 19px;">Thank you for registering your interest in government childcare offers.</p>
    <h2 id="find-out-more" style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Apply now for 30 hours free childcare and Tax-Free Childcare</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you haven't applied already, you’ll need an eligibility code to get a 30 hours free childcare place - apply now to get your code so
        you can book your child's place for the Summer term.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><strong>To apply go to:</strong>
        <a href="http://www.childcare-support.tax.service.gov.uk/par/app/applynow?clicksrc=childcareTaxFreeEngland_B">www.childcare-support.tax.service.gov.uk/par/app/applynow </a></p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you’re already using 30 hours, don't forget you’ll need to confirm you’re still eligible every 3 months to keep getting 30
    hours free childcare. You can do this through your childcare account.</p>

    <h2 id="find-out-more" style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">Tax-Free Childcare</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You may also be eligible for Tax-Free Childcare. For every £8 that you pay into an online childcare account,
        the government will pay in £2, up to a maximum of £2,000 per child per year (or £4,00 for disabled children). You can then use this to pay for childcare.</p>

    <h2 id="find-out-more" style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">Find out more</h2>
