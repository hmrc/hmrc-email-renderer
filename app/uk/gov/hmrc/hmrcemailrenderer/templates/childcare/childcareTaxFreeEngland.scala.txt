About Tax-Free Childcare
Tax-Free Childcare is for working parents with children under 12 years old (or disabled children under 17).
For every £8 that you pay into your childcare account, the government will pay in £2, up to a maximum of £2,000 per child per year (or £4,000 for disabled children). You can then use this to pay for childcare.
You can apply now and start using Tax-Free Childcare to pay for childcare straight away.

About 30 hours free childcare
30 hours free childcare is for working parents of 3 and 4 year old in England.
If you have a child aged 3 or 4 years old, and are eligible, you’ll receive a code. You can then take this to your provider to arrange your place before the launch of 30 hours free childcare in September.

You can find out more and check if you’re eligible at: http://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk
