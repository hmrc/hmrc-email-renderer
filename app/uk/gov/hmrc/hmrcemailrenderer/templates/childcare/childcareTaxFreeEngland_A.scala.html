    <h2 id="About Tax-Free Childcare" style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">About Tax-Free Childcare</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Tax-Free Childcare is to help working parents with the cost of childcare for children under the age of 12 (or under 17 if disabled).</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means that for every £80 that you pay into your childcare account, the government will pay in £20, up to a maximum of £2,000 per child per year (or £4,000 for disabled children). You can then use this to pay for registered childcare.</p>
    <h2 id="About 30 hours free childcare" style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">About 30 hours free childcare</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">30 hours free childcare is for working parents of 3 and 4 year old in England.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you have a child aged 3 or 4 years old, and are eligible, you’ll receive a code. You can then take this to your provider to arrange your place before the launch of 30 hours free childcare in September.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can find out more and check if you’re eligible at:  <a href="http://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk ">www.childcarechoices.gov.uk </a></p>
