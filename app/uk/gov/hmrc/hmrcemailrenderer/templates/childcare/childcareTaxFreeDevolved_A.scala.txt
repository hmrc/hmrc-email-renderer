About Tax-Free Childcare
Tax-Free Childcare is to help working parents with the cost of childcare for children under the age of 12 (or under 17 if disabled).
This means that for every £80 that you pay into your childcare account, the government will pay in £20, up to a maximum of £2,000 per child per year (or £4,000 for disabled children). You can then use this to pay for registered childcare. 

You can find out more and check if you’re eligible at: www.childcarechoices.gov.uk

Thank you for your interest in the childcare service.

Yours faithfully,

Sarah Radford
Childcare Service, HM Government
