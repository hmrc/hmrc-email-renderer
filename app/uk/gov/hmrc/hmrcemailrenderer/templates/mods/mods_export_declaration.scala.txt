Changing your declaration


If you take goods that you have not declared in advance, you must go to the ‘Goods to Declare’ channel or the red point phone in the customs area, if there is one.

From April 2021, you will be able to use this service to add goods to an existing declaration, if they:

- have a total value of £1,500 or less
- weigh a total of 1,000 kilograms or less
- are not subject to excise duty (alcohol, tobacco, fuel)
- are not controlled goods or restricted goods.
