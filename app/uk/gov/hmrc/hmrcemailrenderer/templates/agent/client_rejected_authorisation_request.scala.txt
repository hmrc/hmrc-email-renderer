@(params: Map[String, Any])Your authorisation request was declined

Dear @params("agencyName")

Your client @params("clientName") has declined your request to:

@for(service <- params.keys.toList.filter(_.startsWith("service")).sorted) {- @params(service)
}
What you need to do next

If you think this is a mistake, sign in to your HMRC agent services account and start a new authorisation request for this client.

Do not reply to this email.
