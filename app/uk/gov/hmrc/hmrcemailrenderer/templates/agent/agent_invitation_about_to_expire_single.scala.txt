@(params: Map[String, Any])The authorisation request you sent to your client will expire on @params("expiryDate")

Dear @params("agencyName")

An authorisation request you created on @params("createdDate") will expire on @params("expiryDate").

What you can do next

If you still want your client to authorise you, remind them to select the link you sent them. Selecting this link takes them through the authorisation process.

To track or cancel your authorisation request, sign in to your agent services account and follow the links to ‘track your recent authorisation requests’.

Do not reply to this email – it is an automatic message from an unmonitored account.
