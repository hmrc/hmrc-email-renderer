@(params: Map[String, Any])Your authorisation request expired without being accepted

Dear @params("agencyName")

Your authorisation request to your client @params("clientName") has expired because they did not respond within 14 days.

@params("clientName") did not accept your request to:

@for(service <- params.keys.toList.filter(_.startsWith("service")).sorted) {- @params(service)
}
What you can do next

If you still want @params("clientName") to authorise you, sign in to your HMRC agent services account and start a new authorisation request.

Do not reply to this email.
