@(params: Map[String, Any])Add clients to use access groups

Dear @params("agencyName")

You have turned on access groups in your agent services account.

Our system cannot find any clients linked to this account. You need to add clients before you can use access groups.

To add clients, sign in to your agent services account. You can copy across old authorisations or create a new authorisation request.

Do not reply to this email â€“ it is an automatic message from an unmonitored account.
