@(params: Map[String, Any])The authorisation requests you sent to your clients will expire on @params("expiryDate")

Dear @params("agencyName")

What you can do next

If you still want your clients to authorise you, remind them to select the link you sent them. Selecting this link takes them through the authorisation process.

To track or cancel your authorisation requests, sign in to your agent services account and follow the links to ‘track your recent authorisation requests’.

Do not reply to this email – it is an automatic message from an unmonitored account.
