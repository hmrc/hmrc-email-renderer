@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.txt.salutation(params)

I have reviewed your Binding Tariff Information (BTI) application, and you will receive your ruling certificate with commodity code by email shortly.

The email will also include an explanation of the ruling.

The information from your ruling not marked as confidential has been published as an ATaR on the 'Search for Advance Tariff Rulings' website.

Because you applied before 1 January 2021

You cannot view your ruling online through an ATaR account.

You can sign up for an ATaR account to send future applications by going to GOV.UK and searching for 'Advance Tariff Ruling'.

For security reasons we have not included any links with this email.
