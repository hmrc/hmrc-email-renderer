    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        I have reviewed your Binding Tariff Information (BTI) application, and you will receive your ruling certificate with commodity code by email shortly.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The email will also include an explanation of the ruling.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        The information from your ruling not marked as confidential has been published as an ATaR on the 'Search for Advance Tariff Rulings' website.
    </p>
    <h2>Because you applied before 1 January 2021</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You cannot view your ruling online through an ATaR account.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
        You can sign up for an ATaR account to send future applications by going to GOV.UK and searching for 'Advance Tariff Ruling'.

    <p style="margin: 0px 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">For security reasons we have not included any links with this email.</p>
