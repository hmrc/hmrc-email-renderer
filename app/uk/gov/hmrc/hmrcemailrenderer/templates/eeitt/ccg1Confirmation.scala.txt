You applied for Customs Comprehensive Guarantee authorisation


Dear @params.get("decName")

HMRC received an application on behalf of your business.

Your submission reference is: @params.get("submissionReference")

What happens next

We will review your business's application. If we approve the application, we will confirm the level of guarantee we require from your guarantor.

If we have any questions before we make this decision, we will contact you by email.

What you can do now

You may want to contact an approved financial institution to discuss your guarantee requirements. This could save you time later if we approve your application.

You should not finalise any guarantee arrangements or use any customs procedures until you receive confirmation from HMRC that your application is approved.
