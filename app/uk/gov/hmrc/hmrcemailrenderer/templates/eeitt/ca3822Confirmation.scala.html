    Dear @params("customerName")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We received your application to confirm an employee will pay National Insurance while working abroad (CA3822).
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We aim to write to you within 15 working days. We will confirm whether the employee will continue to be liable to pay UK National Insurance contributions while working abroad.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    If the employee has continuing liability we will send a certificate to confirm this. We will also send state healthcare cover certificates where relevant.
