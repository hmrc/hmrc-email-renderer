<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Dear @params.get("decName") </p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    HMRC received an application on behalf of your business.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Your submission reference is: @params.get("submissionReference")</p>
<h2>
    What happens next</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will review your business's application. If we approve the application, we will confirm the level of guarantee we require from your guarantor.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    If we have any questions before we make this decision, we will contact you by email.</p>
<h2>What you can do now</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    You may want to contact an approved financial institution to discuss your guarantee requirements. This could save you time later if we approve your application.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    You should not finalise any guarantee arrangements or use any customs procedures until you receive confirmation from HMRC that your application is approved.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    From the Customs Comprehensive Guarantee team</p>
