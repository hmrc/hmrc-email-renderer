Dear params("customerName")

We have received your application to register your business for Gaming Duty.

Once we have reviewed your application, we’ll send you a Gaming Duty registration number. You’ll need to provide this number when you contact us about Gaming Duty.

If we need any more details, we’ll contact you by letter, telephone or email. We’ll never ask for your personal details or any other information by email.

You’ll usually receive a reply within 35 days.

How to include or remove premises

Go to GOV.UK and complete the ‘Notify HMRC about premises to include on Gaming Duty Register’ form (GD58). You also need to complete this form for premises used for gaming under Temporary Use Notices. You may be liable to civil penalties if you do not tell us about changes.
