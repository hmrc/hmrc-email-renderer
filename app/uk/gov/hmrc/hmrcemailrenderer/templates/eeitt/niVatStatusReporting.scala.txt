You sent a Northern Ireland Protocol application

Dear Customer

This email confirms that you have told HMRC your business will be operating under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol for VAT.

This is because it will do one or more of the following:

- sell goods located in Northern Ireland at the time of sale
- receive goods in Northern Ireland from VAT registered EU businesses for business purposes
- sell or move goods from Northern Ireland to an EU member state

Note:  it may take up to 2 working days before your suppliers can validate your VAT registration number using the EUâ€™s VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) web service.

You do not need to take any further action.

Your submission reference is: @params.get("submissionReference")
