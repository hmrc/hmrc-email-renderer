    Dear Customer</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    This email confirms that you have told HMRC your business will be operating under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol for VAT.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    This is because it will do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    <li>sell goods located in Northern Ireland at the time of sale</li>

    <li>receive goods in Northern Ireland from VAT registered EU businesses for business purposes</li>

    <li>sell or move goods from Northern Ireland to an EU member state</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
Note:  it may take up to 2 working days before your suppliers can validate your VAT registration number using the EUâ€™s VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) web service.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    You do not need to take any further action.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Your submission reference is: @params.get("submissionReference")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    From HMRC</p>
