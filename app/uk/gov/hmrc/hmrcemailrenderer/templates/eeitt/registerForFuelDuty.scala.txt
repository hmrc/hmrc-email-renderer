Dear Customer,

You submitted a form to register for Fuel Duty online

HMRC has received your application to register a business for Fuel Duty.

What you need to do next

If the business is Excise Payment Security System (EPSS) approved

You must complete a ‘VAT: deferment schedule - SIVA reduced security (SIVA2)’ form. You must complete and send the SIVA2 form as well as a copy of your EPSS approval letter to HMRC. You’ll need to go to GOV.UK and search for the SIVA2 form.
