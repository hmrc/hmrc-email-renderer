@(params: Map[String, Any])

You applied to remove an employer’s name from the register

Dear @params("customerName")

We received your application to remove an employer’s name from the Job Retention Scheme register.

Your submission reference is: @params("submissionReference")

We will now review the details you have given us.

What happens next

We will contact you using the email address you provided to let you know that either:


 • the business meets the exclusion criteria, and HMRC will not publish its details on the register

 • you need to provide more information to help HMRC make a decision

If you do not qualify to be removed from the register

We will contact you to offer the business the opportunity of repaying the grant, which would mean the business’s details will not be included on the register.

For more information, search GOV.UK for ‘Job Retention Scheme’.
