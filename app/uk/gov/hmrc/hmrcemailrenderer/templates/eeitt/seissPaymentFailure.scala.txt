@(params: Map[String, Any])

We have processed your claim and now need you to check your bank details


Dear @params.get("customerName")

Your claim reference: @params.get("claim_ref_no")

We have checked your claim and can confirm that you are eligible to receive a grant.

However, we cannot process your payment with the bank details you provided, so we need you to check these now.

How to check your bank details

Return to the GOV.UK website and search for ‘claim for a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant’. Go to the section ‘return to your claim’ where you will have the option to check and amend your details.

We will then process your payment, which you can expect to receive within 6 working days.

Please only call us if you cannot find the information you need on GOV.UK – this keeps our lines open for those who need our help most.

A word about scams

@Html("We are aware of an increase in scam emails, calls and texts. If someone gets in touch claiming to be from HMRC, saying that financial help can be claimed or that a tax refund is owed, and asks you to click on a link or to give information such as your name, credit card or bank details, please do not respond. You can forward suspicious emails claiming to be from HMRC to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk and texts to 60599.")
