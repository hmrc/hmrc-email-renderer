Dear Customer,

HMRC received your application to register for Air Passenger Duty online.

What you need to do next

If you are a plane operator based outside the UK, you must appoint a UK based agent or representative. For details of how to do this, search GOV.UK for the Air Passenger Duty guidance pages.</p>

If you operate direct long-haul flights from Northern Ireland, you need to contact the Central Assurance Team at APDHelpdesk@@hmrc.gov.uk to let us know.

Why you are receiving this email

We send a confirmation email for a registration submitted online.

From HMRC Excise team
