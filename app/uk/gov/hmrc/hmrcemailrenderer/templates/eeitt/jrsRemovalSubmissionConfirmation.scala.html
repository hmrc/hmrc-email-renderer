    Dear @params.get("customerName")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We received your application to remove an employer’s name from the Job Retention Scheme register.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your submission reference is: @params.get("submissionReference")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will now review the details you have given us.</p>
<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will contact you using the email address you provided to let you know that either:

</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    • the business meets the exclusion criteria, and HMRC will not publish its details on the register
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    • you need to provide more information to help HMRC make a decision</p>
<h2>If you do not qualify to be removed from the register</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will contact you to offer the business the opportunity of repaying the grant, which would mean the business’s
    details will not be included on the register.</p>
