    Dear Customer,</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    HMRC received your application to register for Air Passenger Duty online.</p>
<h2>What you need to do next</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    If you are a plane operator based outside the UK, you must appoint a UK based agent or representative. For details of how to do this, search GOV.UK for the Air Passenger Duty guidance pages.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    If you operate direct long-haul flights from Northern Ireland, you need to contact the Central Assurance Team at APDHelpdesk@@hmrc.gov.uk to let us know.
</p>
<h2>Why you are receiving this email</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We send a confirmation email for a registration submitted online.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    From HMRC Excise team</p>
