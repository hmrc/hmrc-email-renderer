    Dear @params("customerName")</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    This email confirms you provided bank details which HMRC can use to make VAT repayments.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Your reference is: <b>@params("submissionReference")</b></p>
<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    It will take 3 working days to set up the new payment. All future VAT repayments will be made to this account.
</p>
<h2>If you reported unprocessed payable orders</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    We will attempt to cancel POs and resend the money by bank transfer. This takes up to 10 working days.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    If we need to clarify details we will contact you using the email you provided.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    No payment notification will be sent. Check your bank statement for confirmation of payment.</p>
<h2>Keep your details up to date</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    Use the same service to keep your bank details up to date. Search GOV.UK for 'provide banks details for a UK VAT registered overseas trader'.</p>
<h2>Contacting HMRC</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    For your security HMRC will not send personal data by email. You can contact HMRC via the VAT helpline on 0300 200 3700, open Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.</p>
