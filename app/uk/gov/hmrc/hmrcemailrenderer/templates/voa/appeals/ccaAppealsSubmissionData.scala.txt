Valuation Office Agency – check and challenge registration

Proposal Number: @params.getOrElse("proposalNumber", "")
Submission data: @params.getOrElse("submissionUrl", "")

You will not need it to sign in to the check and challenge service – you should continue to use your Government Gateway details to sign in.
