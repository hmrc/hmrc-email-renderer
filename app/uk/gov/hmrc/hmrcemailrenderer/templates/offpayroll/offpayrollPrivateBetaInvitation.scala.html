    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @{params("name")}</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">A test version of the employment status service is ready for you to try. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email includes all the information you'll need to use the service and give us your feedback.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><h2>What the service is for</h2></p>
    
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This is a new tool that can help people find out a worker’s employment status for tax purposes.</p>
    
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Please note: this test version will only give a result about whether the engagement is inside or outside of the intermediaries legislation (known as IR35).</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 0px; font-size: 19px;">It could be used by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a worker providing a service</li>
            <li>a person or company hiring a worker</li>
            <li>an agency that is paying a worker</li>
        </ul>
    

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><b>The decisions given by this version of the service are still being tested and verified.</b></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This means that HMRC will not stand by outcomes given at this stage and you should carry on using existing methods for checking contracts.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We'll be adding more features to the next version of the service.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><h2>How to start testing</h2></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This link will take you straight to the test version of the service:</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><a href="@{params("verificationLink")}" style="color: #005EA5;">@{params("verificationLink")}</a></>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><b>Please don't share this link with other people.</b></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We'll be monitoring how the service is used by invitees and may need to restrict access.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><h2>How to give us your feedback</h2></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If you want to comment on any question please click the feedback link above it. This will open a form for you to tell us what you think. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The more feedback you give us, the better we can make the next version of this service.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><h2>How long testing lasts</h2></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can try this service up to 60 times during the next 30 days.</p>
    
    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">After that we'll make and test a second version of the service based on the feedback we get.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;"><h2>Why you got this email</h2></p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">This email is being sent to people who've been involved in our research so far, or who've volunteered to help us test this service.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Thank you for your help and feedback,</p>
