Thank you for completing your Self Assessment tax return.

Your annual tax summary is now online. It shows ‎how much tax and National Insurance you have paid and how Government spends it.

You can find the summary by signing into your tax account, looking in the self assessment section and selecting 'find out how your tax is spent'.

Tax summaries are for information only so there's no need to take any further action.
