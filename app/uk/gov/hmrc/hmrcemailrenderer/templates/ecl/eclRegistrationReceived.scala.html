        <p>Dear @params("name")</p>

        <p>
            We have received your answers as part of your registration for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL). Please save this email for your records.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What happens next</p>

        <p>
            We will review your answers. We may contact you using the details you provided if we need any more information. This process will take up to 15 working days.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will receive a letter with your ECL reference number after we have matched your details to our records.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can then add the Economic Crime Levy to your business tax account.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How to submit a return</p>

        <p>
            You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.
        </p>

        @if(params.contains("currentFY")) {
            <p>
                The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.
            </p>
        }

        @if(params.contains("previousFY")) {
            @params.get("previousFY").map(_.toString.toInt).map { previousFY =>
                <p>
                    You need to submit a return for the @previousFY to @(previousFY + 1) financial year as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The return will show as overdue because it's in the previous financial year.
                </p>
            }
        }

        <p>
            You will not receive an email or notification from HMRC to remind you to submit a return.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin: 0 0 30px;
            font-size: 19px;">
            <li>the relevant accounting periods for your organisation</li>
            <li>your UK revenue for the relevant accounting periods</li>
            <li>how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year</li>
            <li>the contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why you got this email</p>

        <p>
            This email address is registered as the email address we can use to contact you about the ECL.
        </p>

        <p>Do not respond to this email.</p>

        <p>From HMRC Economic Crime Levy team</p>
