    <div style="margin: 0 0 30px;
        font-size: 19px;">
        <p>Dear @params("name")</p>

        <p>You have registered for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL).</p>

        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2px" style="text-align: left;
            font-size: 19px;">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>ECL reference number</th>
                    <td>@params("eclRegistrationReference")</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <th>ECL registration date</th>
                    <td>@params("eclRegistrationDate")</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What happens next</p>

        <p>
            You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How to submit a return</p>

        @if(params("privateBetaEnabled").toString.toBoolean) {
            <p>You cannot submit a return right now. You will be able to submit a return later.</p>
        } else {
            <p>You can submit a return by going to the Returns section of your ECL account.</p>
        }

        <p>When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:</p>

        <ul style="margin: 0 0 30px;
            font-size: 19px;">
            <li>the relevant accounting period for your organisation</li>
            <li>your UK revenue for the relevant accounting period</li>
            <li>how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year</li>
            <li>the name, role, and contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why you got this email</p>

        @if(params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
            <p>This is the email address you provided when you registered.</p>
        }

        @if(params.contains("secondContactEmail") && params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
            <p>We have also sent this email to @params("secondContactEmail") because you added them as a contact when you registered.</p>
        }

        @if(!params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
            <p>We have sent you this email because you were added as a contact when someone in your organisation registered for the ECL.</p>
        }

        <p>Do not respond to this email.</p>

        <p>From HMRC Economic Crime Levy team</p>
