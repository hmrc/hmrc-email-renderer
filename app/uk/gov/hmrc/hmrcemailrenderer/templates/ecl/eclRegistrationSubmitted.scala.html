        <p>Dear @params("name")</p>

        <p>We have received your registration for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL).</p>

        <p>
            Your ECL reference number is @params("eclRegistrationReference").
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What happens next</p>

        <p>
            You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.
            The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue").
            You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.

        <ul style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
            <li>the relevant accounting period for your organisation</li>
            <li>your UK revenue for the relevant accounting period</li>
            <li>how long you carried out Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year</li>
            <li>the name, role, and contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why you got this email</p>

        <p>This email address is registered as the email address we can use to contact you about the ECL.</p>
