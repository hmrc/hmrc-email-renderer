@(params: Map[String, Any])
You have registered for the Economic Crime Levy

Dear @params("name")

You have registered for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL).

ECL reference number @params("eclRegistrationReference")
ECL registration date @params("eclRegistrationDate")

What happens next

You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.

The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.

How to submit a return

@if(params("privateBetaEnabled").toString.toBoolean) {
You cannot submit a return right now. You will be able to submit a return later.
} else {
You can submit a return by going to the Returns section of your ECL account.
}

When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:

    - the relevant accounting period for your organisation
    - your UK revenue for the relevant accounting period
    - how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year
    - the name, role, and contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return

Why you got this email

@if(params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
This is the email address you provided when you registered.
}

@if(params.contains("secondContactEmail") && params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
We have also sent this email to @params("secondContactEmail") because you added them as a contact when you registered.
}

@if(!params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {
We have sent you this email because you were added as a contact when someone in your organisation registered for the ECL.
}

Do not respond to this email.
