Dear @params("name")

You have registered for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL).

ECL reference number @params("eclRegistrationReference")
ECL registration date @params("eclRegistrationDate")

What happens next

You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.

You will not receive an email or notification from HMRC to remind you to submit a return.

@if(params.contains("currentFY")) {
The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.
}

@if(params.contains("previousFY")) { @params.get("previousFY").map(_.toString.toInt).map { previousFY =>
You need to submit a return for any previous financial years as soon as possible. They will show as overdue.
}}

How to submit a return

You can submit a return by going to the Returns section of your ECL account.

When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:

    - the relevant accounting period for your organisation
    - your UK revenue for the relevant accounting period
    - how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year
    - the name, role, and contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return

Why you got this email

@if(params("isPrimaryContact").toString.toBoolean) {

}

We have sent you this email because you were added as a contact when someone in your organisation registered for the ECL.
}
