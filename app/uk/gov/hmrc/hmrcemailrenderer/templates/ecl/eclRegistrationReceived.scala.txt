@(params: Map[String, Any])
Your Economic Crime Levy registration has been received

Dear @params("name")

We have received your answers as part of your registration for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL). Please save this email for your records.

What happens next

We will review your answers. We may contact you using the details you provided if we need any more information. This process will take up to 15 working days.

You will receive a letter with your ECL reference number after we have matched your details to our records.

You can then add the Economic Crime Levy to your business tax account.

How to submit a return

You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.

@if(params.contains("currentFY")) {
The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.
}

@if(params.contains("previousFY")) { @params.get("previousFY").map(_.toString.toInt).map { previousFY =>
You need to submit a return for the @previousFY to @(previousFY + 1) financial year as soon as possible.
The return will show as overdue because it's in the previous financial year.
}}

You will not receive an email or notification from HMRC to remind you to submit a return.

When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:

    - the relevant accounting periods for your organisation
    - your UK revenue for the relevant accounting periods
    - how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year
    - the contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return
