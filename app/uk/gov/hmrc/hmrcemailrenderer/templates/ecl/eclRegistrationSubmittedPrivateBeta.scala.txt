@(params: Map[String, Any])
Economic Crime Levy registration submitted

Dear @params("name")

You have submitted a registration for the Economic Crime Levy (ECL).

Your ECL reference number is @params("eclRegistrationReference"). Please save this for your records.

What happens next

You will need to complete a return and pay the levy on a yearly basis.

The next deadline for submitting a return and making a payment is @params("dateDue"). You will be charged interest if you make a late payment.

How to submit a return

You cannot submit a return right now. You will be able to submit a return later.

When you complete your yearly return, you will need to tell us about:

    - the relevant accounting period for your organisation
    - your UK revenue for the relevant accounting period
    - how long you carried out anti-money laundering (AML) regulated activities during the financial year
    - the name, role, and contact details of the person in your organisation who is completing the return
