Dear @{params("f_name")} @{params("s_name")}
Thank you for taking part in the private beta phase of the country-by-country digital service.
Here is your new country-by-country ID, which replaces the one you created for private beta:
@{params("cbcrId")}

What happens next?

You’ll need to sign into the reporting service at the following address to validate your new country-by-country ID:
https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/country-by-country-reporting-private-beta-1/report/upload-form

Make sure you keep the ID safe, as you must use it from now on each time you send a country-by-country report.
