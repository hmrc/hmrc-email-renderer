    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">We are unable to process your application because the personal details provided do not match our records.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">WHAT TO DO NOW</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">You will need to check or update your client’s personal details before resubmitting the form.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">You can ask HMRC to update your client’s personal details. Go to GOV.UK and search for “Tell HMRC about a change to your personal details” and look for “Change of name or address”. Changes may take up to 15 days to complete.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Alternatively, your client can update their personal details online immediately using their personal tax account. </p>
