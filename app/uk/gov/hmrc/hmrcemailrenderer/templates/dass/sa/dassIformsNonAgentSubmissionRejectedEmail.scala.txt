@(params: Map[String, Any])

Your HMRC application has been rejected

Dear @params("name")

We have received your application to register for Self Assessment.
We could not process your application because your personal details do not match our records.

What to do next

You need to check and update your details on your personal tax account before you can resubmit the application.

If you do not have a personal tax account, you can set one up. On the GOV.UK website, search ‘PTA’ and find the page ‘Personal tax account: sign in or set up’.
