Action Required: HMRC Application Rejected

The HMRC application for your client has been rejected

Dear Agent

We have received an application to register your client @params("name") for Self Assessment.

We could not process the application because your client’s personal details do not match our records.

What to do next

Check that you entered your client’s details correctly on the application.

If you did, then your client should check and update their details on their personal tax account.

You can also ask HMRC to update your client’s details. On the GOV.UK website, search for ‘change personal details’ and find the page ‘Tell HMRC about a change to your personal details’. This may take up to 15 days.

Once your client’s personal details have been updated, you can resubmit the application.

From HMRC Digital
