Action Required: HMRC Application Rejected

We have received an application to register for Self Assessment for your client @params("name").
We are unable to process your application because the personal details provided do not match our records.

WHAT TO DO NOW

You will need to check or update your client’s personal details before resubmitting the form.
You can ask HMRC to update your client’s personal details. Go to GOV.UK and search for “Tell HMRC about a change to your personal details” and look for “Change of name or address”. Changes may take up to 15 days to complete.
Alternatively, your client can update their personal details online immediately using their personal tax account.
