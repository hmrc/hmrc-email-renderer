 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Dear @{params("psaName").toString}</p>

 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your submission reference number is: <span style="font-weight:bold">@{params("srn").toString}</span></p>

 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">The pension scheme has not been registered yet. HMRC will review the application and make a decision. You will be contacted if there are any other details needed.</p>

 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0; font-weight: bold">How to check the status of the application</p>

 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">You can use the ‘Managing Pension Schemes’ service to check the status of the application. More information can be found on the ‘apply to register a pension scheme’ page on GOV.UK.</p>

 <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There is no time limit for how long it will take HMRC to make a decision. You can appeal to a tribunal if HMRC declines the application or if a decision has not been made within 6 months. You can find details of how to do this on the ‘apply to register a pension scheme’ page on GOV.UK.</p>
