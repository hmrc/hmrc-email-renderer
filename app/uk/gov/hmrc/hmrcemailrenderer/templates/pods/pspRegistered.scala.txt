You have been registered as a pension scheme practitioner

Dear @{params("pspName").toString}

This email confirms your registration as a pension scheme practitioner.

What to do next

You should pass on the practioner ID to your pension scheme administrator.

You only need one practitioner ID, even if you are a practitioner for more than one pension scheme. This ID allows you to be authorised for all relevant schemes using the online service.
