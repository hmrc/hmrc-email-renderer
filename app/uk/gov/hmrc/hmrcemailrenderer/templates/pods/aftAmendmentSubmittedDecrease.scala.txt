Reduced charge

The amendment you have submitted has reduced the charge for this Accounting for Tax return.

If you have any outstanding AFT charges for this quarter
A credit has been created and will be allocated to another AFT charge for this quarter.

You can view this in your payments and charges by signing in to the Managing Pension Schemes service. Search for 'manage a registered pension scheme' on GOV.UK and then choose the online service.

If you’ve paid all AFT charges for this quarter
The credit will sit on the scheme’s account. You can contact HMRC to request a refund, or a reallocation of the credit to other charges in other periods.

To do this, search for ‘Pension schemes refund or reallocation request’ on GOV.UK.
