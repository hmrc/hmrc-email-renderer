You are no longer a pension scheme practitioner

Dear @{params("pspName").toString}

You have deregistered yourself as a pension scheme practitioner.

What happens next

You can no longer access the Managing Pension Schemes service using your practitioner ID.

You will have to register as a pension scheme practitioner again if you need a practitioner ID in the future.
