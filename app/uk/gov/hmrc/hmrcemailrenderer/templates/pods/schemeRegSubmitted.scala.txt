@(params: Map[String, Any])

You have applied to register a new pension scheme with HMRC

Dear @{params("psaName").toString}

Your submission reference number is: @{params("srn").toString}

The pension scheme has not been registered yet. HMRC will review the application and make a decision. You will be contacted if there are any other details needed.

How to check the status of the application

You can use the ‘Managing Pension Schemes’ service to check the status of the application. More information can be found on the ‘apply to register a pension scheme’ page on GOV.UK.

There is no time limit for how long it will take HMRC to make a decision. You can appeal to a tribunal if HMRC declines the application or if a decision has not been made within 6 months. You can find details of how to do this on the ‘apply to register a pension scheme’ page on GOV.UK.

For security reasons, we have not included a link with this email.
