@(params: Map[String, Any])We have received your PAYE application for @params("companyName")

Your application reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")

What happens next

You will receive an email letting you know the outcome of your application.

If your application is successful, we will send you:

- a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers (you will need these to send payroll information to HMRC)
- an activation code in the post so that you can manage the companyâ€™s PAYE online

Due to the volume of registrations that we currently have, it may take longer for you to receive your employer PAYE reference number.

We are working hard to resolve the backlog of cases and apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

From HM Revenue & Customs PAYE
