@(params: Map[String, Any])We have received your PAYE application for @params("companyName")

Thank you for your application.

Your reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")

What happens next

We will send you an email to tell you if your application is successful. If it is, we will send you:

- a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers. You will need these to send payroll information to HMRC
- an activation code in the post so you can manage the companyâ€™s PAYE online

We are currently working through a large volume of registration applications so it might take a few weeks for you to receive your employer PAYE reference number.
