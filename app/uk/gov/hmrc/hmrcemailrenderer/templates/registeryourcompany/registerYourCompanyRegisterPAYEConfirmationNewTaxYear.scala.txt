@(params: Map[String, Any])We have received your PAYE application for @params("companyName")

Dear Customer

Your application reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")

Please do not contact us about the application until after 17 May.

What happens next

You can still do payroll but you should:

- hold off on sending a Full Payment Submission until you have the company's PAYE registration details
- enter HMRC code G in the 'late reporting reason' box

If your application is successful, we will send you:

- a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers within 5 working days of the application approved (you will need these to send payroll information to HMRC)
- an activation code in the post so you can manage the companyâ€™s PAYE online

From HM Revenue & Customs PAYE
