@(params: Map[String, Any])We have received your PAYE application for @params("companyName")

Your application reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")

The company’s first payment to someone is in the next tax year, so we will not start processing your application until after the next tax year begins (6 April).

Please do not contact us about the application until after 17 May.

What happens next

You can still do payroll but you should:

- hold off on sending a Full Payment Submission until you have the company's PAYE registration details
- enter HMRC code G in the 'late reporting reason' box

If your application is successful, we will send you:

- a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers within 5 working days of the application being approved (you will need these to send payroll information to HMRC)
- an activation code in the post so you can manage the company’s PAYE online
