@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.html.template_main(params, s"We have received your PAYE application for ${params("companyName")}") {

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Thank you for your application.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We will send you an email to tell you if your application is successful. If it is, we will send you:</p>

<ul style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    <li>a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers. You will need these to send payroll information to HMRC</li>
    <li>an activation code in the post so you can manage the companyâ€™s PAYE online</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">We are currently working through a large volume of registration applications so it might take a few weeks for you to receive your employer PAYE reference number.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">From HMRC PAYE</p>
