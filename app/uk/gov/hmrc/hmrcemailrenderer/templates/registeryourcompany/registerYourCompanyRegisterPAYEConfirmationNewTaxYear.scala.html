@uk.gov.hmrc.hmrcemailrenderer.templates.helpers.html.template_main(params, s"We have received your PAYE application for ${params("companyName")}") {

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Your application reference number is: @params("referenceNumber")</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">The company’s first payment to someone is in the next tax year, so we will not start processing your application until after the next tax year begins (6 April).</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Please do not contact us about the application until after 17 May.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can still do payroll but you should:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    <li>hold off on sending a Full Payment Submission until you have the company's PAYE registration details</li>
    <li>enter HMRC code G in the 'late reporting reason' box</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">If your application is successful, we will send you:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">
    <li>a letter with PAYE and Accounts Office reference numbers within 5 working days of the application being approved (you will need these to send payroll information to HMRC)</li>
    <li>an activation code in the post so you can manage the company’s PAYE online</li>
</ul>
