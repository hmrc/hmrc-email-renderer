Thanks for using the new Marriage Allowance service. Your transfer was successful.

We’ll reduce your Personal Allowance by £1,060 and increase your spouse or civil partner's allowance by the same amount. This will apply for the current tax year and will continue into future tax years.

If your spouse or civil partner usually completes a Self Assessment return, we’ll write to them to confirm the transfer.

If they’re employed and pay tax via PAYE, we’ll send them a revised notice of tax coding by post in due course.

There is no need to contact us.
