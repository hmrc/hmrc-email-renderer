What happens next

If your partner pays tax through PAYE, we’ll send them a cheque in the post for each tax year you are eligible for.

If your partner completes a Self Assessment tax return, we’ll send a cheque in the post or deduct the amount from their next tax bill (depending on the preference they’ve registered with HMRC).

There’s no need to contact us.
