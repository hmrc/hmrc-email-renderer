Confirmation of your Marriage Allowance application

What happens next

If your partner pays tax through PAYE, we will send them a cheque in the post based on your application. For any years that you are not eligible, you may underpay and owe tax.

If your partner completes a Self Assessment tax return, we’ll send a cheque in the post or deduct the amount from their next tax bill (depending on the preference they’ve registered with HMRC).

There’s no need to contact us.
