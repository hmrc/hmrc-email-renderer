<p style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">What happens next</p>

<p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Current tax year</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your partner pays tax through PAYE they will receive notification of their new tax code in the post. We&rsquo;ll tell their employer and your Marriage Allowance will start when they begin using this new code. If you are claiming part way through the tax year, their Marriage Allowance will be backdated to the start of the current tax year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your partner completes a Self Assessment tax return, their tax bill will be adjusted to include Marriage Allowance when they file their return.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your Marriage Allowance will automatically continue until you or your partner cancel it, or youâ€™re no longer eligible as a couple.</p>

<p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Earlier tax years</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your partner pays tax through PAYE, we will send them a cheque in the post based on your application. For any years that you are not eligible, you may underpay and owe tax.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your partner completes a Self Assessment tax return, we&rsquo;ll send a cheque in the post or deduct the amount from their next tax bill (depending on the preference they&rsquo;ve registered with HMRC).</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There&rsquo;s no need to contact us.</p>
