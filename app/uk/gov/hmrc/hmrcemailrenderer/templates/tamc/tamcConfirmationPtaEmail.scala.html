<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">We&rsquo;ll reduce your personal allowance by &pound;1,060 and increase your spouse or civil partner&rsquo;s allowance by the same amount. This will apply for the current tax year and will continue into future tax years.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your spouse or civil partner usually completes a Self Assessment return, we&rsquo;ll write to them to confirm the transfer.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If they&rsquo;re employed and pay tax via PAYE, we&rsquo;ll send them a revised notice of tax coding by post in due course.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your revised notice of tax coding will show in your personal account within 24 hours.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There is no need to contact us.</p>
