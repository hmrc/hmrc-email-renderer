@(params: Map[String, Any])

Marriage Allowance cancelled

Your Marriage Allowance will be cancelled on @{params("endDate")}, at the end of the current tax year.

What happens next

If your partner pays tax through PAYE, we’ll change their tax code and send them notification of their new tax code in the post. We’ll tell their employer and your Marriage Allowance will stop when they begin using this new code from the start of the new tax year on @{params("startDate")}.

If they complete a Self Assessment tax return, we’ll remove Marriage Allowance at the end of the current tax year on @{params("endDate")}. Their Personal Allowance will be adjusted on @{params("startDate")}.

Your revised notice of tax coding will show in your personal tax account within 24 hours.
