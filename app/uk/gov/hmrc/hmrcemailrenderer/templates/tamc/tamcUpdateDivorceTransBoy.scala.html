<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your Marriage Allowance has been cancelled from @{params("startDate")}, the start of the current tax year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">What happens next</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your former partner pays tax through PAYE, we&rsquo;ll change their tax code. We&rsquo;ll tell their employer and your Marriage Allowance will stop when they begin using this new code.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If they complete a Self Assessment tax return, we&rsquo;ll remove Marriage Allowance from the start of the current tax year on @{params("startDate")}.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Cancelling Marriage Allowance could result in your former partner not paying enough tax. We&rsquo;ll let them know if they&rsquo;ve paid the right amount when we check their pay and tax information at the end of the tax year. If they&rsquo;ve underpaid, we&rsquo;ll collect the tax they owe by adjusting their tax code.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your revised notice of tax coding will show in your personal tax account within 24 hours.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There&rsquo;s no need to contact us. You can check the status of your Marriage Allowance on your personal tax account by clicking the link below.</p>
