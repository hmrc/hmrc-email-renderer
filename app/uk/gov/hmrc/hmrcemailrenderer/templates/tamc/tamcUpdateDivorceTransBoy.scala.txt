@(params: Map[String, Any])

Marriage Allowance cancelled

Your Marriage Allowance has been cancelled from @{params("startDate")}, the start of the current tax year.

What happens next

If your former partner pays tax through PAYE, we’ll change their tax code. We’ll tell their employer and your Marriage Allowance will stop when they begin using this new code.

If they complete a Self Assessment tax return, we’ll remove Marriage Allowance from the start of the current tax year on @{params("startDate")}.

Cancelling Marriage Allowance could result in your former partner not paying enough tax. We’ll let them know if they’ve paid the right amount when we check their pay and tax information at the end of the tax year. If they’ve underpaid, we’ll collect the tax they owe by adjusting their tax code.

Your revised notice of tax coding will show in your personal tax account within 24 hours.

There’s no need to contact us. You can check the status of your Marriage Allowance on your personal tax account by clicking the link below.
