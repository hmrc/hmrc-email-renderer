<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your former partner pays tax through PAYE, we&rsquo;ll change their tax code and tell their employer to start using it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Cancelling Marriage Allowance could result in you not paying enough tax. We&rsquo;ll let you know if you&rsquo;ve paid the right amount when we check your pay and tax information at the end of the tax year. If you&rsquo;ve underpaid, we&rsquo;ll collect the tax you owe by adjusting your tax code.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There&rsquo;s no need to contact us. You can check the status of your Marriage Allowance on your personal tax account by clicking the link below.</p>
