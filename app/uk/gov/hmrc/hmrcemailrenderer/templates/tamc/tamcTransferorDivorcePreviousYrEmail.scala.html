<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">Your Marriage Allowance has been cancelled from @{params("endDate")}, the end of the tax year you divorced.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">What happens next</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If your former partner pays tax through PAYE, we&rsquo;ll change their tax code and send them notification of their new tax code in the post. We&rsquo;ll tell their employer and your Marriage Allowance will stop when they begin using this new code.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">If they complete a Self Assessment tax return, we&rsquo;ll remove Marriage Allowance from @{params("endDate")}, the end of the tax year you divorced. Their Personal Allowance will be adjusted from @{params("startDate")}.</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.315789474; margin: 0 0 30px 0;">There&rsquo;s no need to contact us. You can check the status of your Marriage Allowance on your personal tax account by clicking the link below.</p>
