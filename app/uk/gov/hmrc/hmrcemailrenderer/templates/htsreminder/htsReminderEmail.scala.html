<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @{params("name")}</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Try and save as much of your monthly £50 Help to Save allowance as you can this @{params("month")}. </p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can deposit any amount from £1 to £50, and anything you save now can help you earn the highest possible bonus.</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Just remember, you cannot carry over any of your unused £50 allowance to next month.</p>
