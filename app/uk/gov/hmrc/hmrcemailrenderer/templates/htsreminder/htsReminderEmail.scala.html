<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Dear @{params("name")}</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Try and save as much of your monthly £50 Help to Save allowance as you can this @{params("month")}. </p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">You can deposit as little as £1 at a time, as many times as you want, but you can only save £50 each calendar month.</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 19px;">Remember, you can get a bonus of 50p for every pound you save.</p>
