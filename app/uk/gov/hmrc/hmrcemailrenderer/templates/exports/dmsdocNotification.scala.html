    <div style="margin: 0 0 30px; font-size: 18px;">
        <p>Dear Declarant</p>

        <p>A Route 1 means the required documents must be uploaded and attached to your declaration.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What you need to do now</p>

        <p>
            If you have not already attached the required documents to this declaration, then
            you need to sign in and do this now so they can be checked when your goods progress.
        </p>

        <p>To access the online service and upload files to the declaration with movement reference number (MRN) @params("mrn"):</p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Search online for 'Upload documents and get messages for the Customs Declaration Service' on the GOV.UK website.</li>
                <li>Sign in from that page using the Government Gateway user ID and password that are linked to your EORI number.</li>
                <li>Select the option to 'Attach documents to a declaration'. You will need to enter @params("mrn") and then upload your documents.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>You can also sign into the CDS exports declaration service and upload documents from the declaration information page for this MRN.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Required documents</p>

        <p>You need to attach scans or PDFs of:</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>documents declared in section 4 (previous documents)</li>
                <li>certificates, permits, licences etc declared in section 5 (documents produced)</li>
                <li>packing list</li>
                <li>evidence of value (invoice(s)) if needed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>If you have already attached these you do not have to attach them again unless you get a query that asks you to do so.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If a query is raised in Documentary Control</p>

        <p>If a query is raised, we will send an alert to this email address about the action you need to take.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why you got this email</p>

        <p>You chose to receive exports notifications about the Customs Declaration Service to this email address.</p>

        <p>
            Please note, these email notifications are only sent to this email address, which is the CDS registered email address.
